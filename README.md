CenterBoxes
===========

Jquery plugin to center content boxes horizontally and vertically within the browser window.

Usage
=====

Create outer div with a class of "container" then inside that create a div with a class of "centerbox". Place all content inside the div labeled "centerbox". Plugin will size outer container to be the browser window size. Then centerbox will center itself in that container.

"centerbox" can be styled however you wish, but be sure to declare some kind of width. Do not place any content between "container" and "centerbox", it will throw off the margins.
